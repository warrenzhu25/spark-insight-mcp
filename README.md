### 💡 How Prompts Enhance AI Analysis

**Intelligent Prompts provide:**
- **Structured Frameworks**: Guide AI agents through systematic analysis approaches
- **Domain Expertise**: Encode Spark performance knowledge into reusable templates
- **Tool Recommendations**: Suggest optimal MCP tool sequences for different scenarios
- **Consistent Analysis**: Ensure comprehensive coverage of key performance areas
- **Tailored Output**: Generate analysis appropriate for different audiences (technical, executive)

**Example: Using the `analyze_slow_application` prompt:**
```
User: "My Spark job app-12345 is running slower than expected"
AI Agent: Uses analyze_slow_application("app-12345") prompt
Result: Structured investigation covering:
  • Application performance baseline comparison
  • Bottleneck identification using get_job_bottlenecks
  • Resource utilization analysis via analyze_executor_utilization
  • Data skew detection with analyze_shuffle_skew
  • Configuration review and optimization recommendations
```

## 🆕 Recent Improvements: Timeline Comparison Tools

The timeline comparison tools have been enhanced with major improvements for cleaner analysis:

### ✨ **Simplified Output Focus**
- **Executor-Only Metrics**: Timeline comparisons now focus exclusively on executor count differences, removing memory and CPU noise
- **Streamlined Data**: Cleaner output makes it easier to identify meaningful resource allocation patterns
- **Reduced Complexity**: Simplified comparison data structure improves readability and analysis speed

### 🔄 **Intelligent Interval Merging**
- **Consecutive Consolidation**: Adjacent time intervals with identical executor counts are automatically merged
- **Duration Tracking**: Merged intervals include `duration_intervals` showing how many original intervals were consolidated
- **Noise Reduction**: Significantly reduces output size while preserving all critical information

### 📊 **Enhanced Summary Statistics**
- **Dual Metrics**: Shows both `original_intervals` and `merged_intervals` counts for transparency
- **Improved Insights**: Summary statistics calculated on merged data provide more meaningful analysis
- **Better Tracking**: Clear visibility into the effectiveness of interval consolidation

### 🛠️ **Affected Tools**
- `compare_stage_executor_timeline` - Stage-level timeline comparison with merged intervals
- `compare_app_executor_timeline` - Application-level timeline comparison with simplified output

These improvements make timeline analysis more focused and actionable while maintaining full backward compatibility.
